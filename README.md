# Mall-Customer-Segmentation

## Problem Statement
 Malls and shopping areas are these days are getting bigger and bigger. It is harder for the shoppers to gain deeper understanding of customer behaviours about the product items and shopping score of customer on the particular zone product of food,footwear, entertainment,clothing.  If suppose we own the mall  and want to understand the customers like who can easily coverge Target Customers, so that sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly. For these problem we are using one of the unsupervised Machine learning algorithm called hiearchical base clustering algorithm. This technique is used to cluster the customer based on the behaviour on purchasing a product items on mall.

## How it works

Explanation: Customer segmentation is the division of a customers into categories called customer segments, such that each customer segment exhibits similar characteristics. This dvision of customers is built on factors that can directly or indirectly affect the market or business such as product preferences or expectation, location, behaviours etc. Customer segmentation can be implemented through clustering, which is one of the highly recognized machine learning technique. Cluster analysis is applied in many business application from customized marketing to industry analysis. It helps to comprehend the natural grouping in a dataset and create clusters of similar records which depends on several measurement made in the form attributes. In this project foucsed on creating customers clusters by using Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering algorithm .This features involved in our dataset are customerId,gender,age, food, footwear,spending score of footwear etc.

## Hiearchical Clustering
 Hierarchical clustering is another unsupervised machine learning algorithm which is used to group the unlabeled datasets into cluster and known as hiearchical clustering analysis.

 ## Conclusion
 Hence we get the  strategy based on their products
